Baysian network based mystry solver model.
What is baysian network ?
A Bayesian Network (also known as a Belief Network) is a probabilistic graphical model that illustrates a collection of variables and their probabilistic relationships through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It serves as a robust instrument for reasoning amidst uncertainty, frequently employed in areas such as artificial intelligence, decision-making, diagnostics, and natural language processing.

In pytorch , we have pgmpy library.From pgmpy we have to import BaysianNetwork , TabularCPD , VariableElimination. 
We will create baysian network from scratch.
